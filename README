DueCountGenerator was an addon for the Anki SRS flash card software for use with the (now discontinued) iPad app Status Board by Panic. Status Board was an app for displaying calendars, graphs, clocks, RSS Feeds, or any other kind of data in a dashboard like format. When I was studying Japanese several hours a day, I thought it would be cool to display my due review card counts for the day as well as how many I had completed recently. 

DueCountGenerator scrapes the AnkiWeb homepage to get a list of decks and due counts, which it then writes to a csv file for use by the Status Board App. The addon file is added to the anki addon API, and calls the generator when Anki is quit (after the sync to AnkiWeb is finished).

A second part of DueCountGenerator is another addon for Anki which writes a deck collection report to a html file on close. DueCountGenerator then parses this file to extract the number of reviewed cards for each of the last 30 days and writes the results to a JSON file which encodes the information in a bar graph for display in Status Board. 

Once set up as an addon initially, no extra work is required. When Anki is closed, DueCountGenerator runs and updates the csv and JSON files, which are written to a DropBox folder. When Status Board runs it fetches the files from DropBox and displays the information on the iPad. 

A screenshot showing an example of the result is available in the repository. 

NOTE: This addon was written specifically for my use with an old version of Anki, and as such is hard-coded in several locations for my file path. It was also written expecting a very particular format for the Anki decks report collection and AnkiWeb webpage. Attempting to run it on a modern version of Anki would likely at best not work, and at worst potentially corrupt Anki decks. I currently have no plans to check it for compatibility or update it, as Status Board no longer works and I am not currently using Anki on a daily basis.
